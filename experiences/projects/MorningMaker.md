Coffee isn't breakfast, but what happens when you're trying to squeeze every last second of sleep out of your morning routine? Usually you skip breakfast lieu of coffee. During HackTheHome 2018, my team thought we'd make a product to make this process easier. You can schedule your coffee to be ready in the morning, why not have your breakfast ready itself as well? After taking apart an old toaster oven and coffee maker, we created a new metal casing, adding a touch screen for scheduling, a thermocouple for measuring temperature precisely, and some relay switches for controlling the AC heating units using the raspberry pi.
