Won second place overall in HackTheHill Fall 2016 Hackathon. In the game, you're an agent trying to hack into a terminal using two buttons while Edward Snowden tries to stop you. You must fight back before he reaches you or it's game over. Difficulties included collision physics, simulated terminals, and spawn mechanics.
