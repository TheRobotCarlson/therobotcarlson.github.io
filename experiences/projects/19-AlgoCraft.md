Project Malmo and Minecraft provide a platform for teaching basic programming, algorithms, and reinforcement learning. AlgoCraft is a wrapper around those projects designed to provide a learning platform for students learning programming all the way to learning advanced algorithms. Packaged into Docker container, deployed to Google Cloud, spawns a new container instance for each user.
