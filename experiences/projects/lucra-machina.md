- Built and optimized a cryptocurrency trading bot framework and bots to run on it, my main project for the last 2 - 3 years.  

- Started with Python multiprocessing, worker-queue model and MongoDB for concurrent data pipeline management, transitioned into a pub-sub model running on AWS.

- Executed orders from simultaneously across multiple exchanges with extremely small (> 10 ms) difference in timing.

- Created custom online-math module to calculate key statistics and trade triggers very quickly in a single pass.

- Trained a reinforcement learning model to  choose which strategies should be active and if they need to be re-trained.

- Created status and management pages in Vue for monitoring training progress, internal notifications, live trading account balance, and training backtest time periods.

- Led multiple separate teams for development on project.

- Won two separate pitch competitions for idea, winning  $750 and $2000
