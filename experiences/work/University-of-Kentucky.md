I graduated in May 2019 from University of Kentucky with dual degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering and a minor in Math. This made me the first generation in my family to graduate from college. During my time at UK, I started <a href="http://acm.cs.uky.edu/hackmadness/">UK HackMadness</a>, a series of workshops teaching skills students don't learn in school including using Github, developing apps, and deploying machine learning models. I was also the lead organizer of <a href="cathacks.com">CatHacks V</a>, Kentucky's largest <a href="https://mlh.io/">MLH sponsored</a> hackathon. I participated in UK's programming team, built learning tools for professors, competed in <a href="https://devpost.com/TheRobotCarlson">many hackathons</a>, and made various side projects.
