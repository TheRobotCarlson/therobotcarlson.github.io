At 16 I left home to attend the <a href="https://www.wku.edu/academy/">Gatton Academy</a>, a 2 year residential STEM high school with some of the best and brightest minds in Kentucky. While there I did <a href="/experiences/fret-visualizer/">physics research</a>, competed in the <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb">National Science Bowl</a>, participated in robotics competitions, cryptography club (of which I founded), and gained over 90 college credit hours. I met Bill Nye, Michio Kaku, the <a href="#TODO">head of NASA</a>, and many other awesome people. I graduated in May 2015, but continue to keep in touch with the 60 members of my graduating class.
