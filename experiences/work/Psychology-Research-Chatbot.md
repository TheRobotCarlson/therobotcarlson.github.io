Provided insight for guiding human interaction in creativity studies. Developed a chatbot for aiding research studies using chat data gathered from Discord servers. Created virtual chat agents inside Second Life game for studies.

During this time, I analyzed over 1.5 million chat messages from across over 300 Discord chat servers and built a chatbot that acted like a subset of that server.
