Created Monte Carlo simulations for research on [Förster Resonance Energy Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer) (FRET) for Dr. Wieb van der Meer at Western Kentucky University. After running the simulation over a range of input angles, chromophore distance, and emission spectrum values and getting the quantum yield efficiency, I modeled the data to a series of equations that simplified existing models and provided more useful data. I also build a [visualization tool](/projects/fret/) for better visualizing the equations around FRET.
