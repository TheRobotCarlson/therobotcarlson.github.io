Using Firebase, a bootstrap website, and a Swift app, my group built an app that would allow employees to give anonymous feedback for company improvement. This came about after some members of our group worked in the Norwegian steel industry and said many employees had ideas for improvement, but weren't sure how to bring them up to their bosses or if the improvements might lead to negative consequences for themselves. This was our solution to that problem.\r\n\r\nWe received second place in the main event and also second place in the Peopleâ€™s Choice award.","company":"","fileInfo":{"directory":"projects"},"tags":[{"title":"nodejs","path":"/tag/nodejs/"},{"title":"javascript","path":"/tag/javascript/"},{"title":"firebase","path":"/tag/firebase/"},{"title":"startup-weekend","path":"/tag/startup-weekend/"},{"title":"hackathon","path":"/tag/hackathon/"}]}},"context":{}}
