After running the simulation over a range of input angles, chromophore distance, and emission spectrum values and getting the quantum yield efficiency, I modeled the data to a series of equations that simplified existing models and provided more useful data. I also build a [visualization tool](/projects/fret/) for better visualizing the equations around FRET.","company":"Western Kentucky University Physics Department","fileInfo":{"directory":"work"},"tags":[{"title":"mathematica","path":"/tag/mathematica/"},{"title":"monte-carlo","path":"/tag/monte-carlo/"},{"title":"igor","path":"/tag/igor/"},{"title":"visual-basic","path":"/tag/visual-basic/"},{"title":"research","path":"/tag/research/"},{"title":"data-visualization","path":"/tag/data-visualization/"}]}},"context":{}}
