Additionally, the app is linked to a daily hardware pill planner with LED indicators to designate whether or not medications for a particular day need to be taken (the current day will be highlighted blue if medication for the day has been taken). The pill planner was made using a raspberry pi, LEDs, and a store-bought pill container. Additionally, using the Telegram API, Medcheck will send a reminder to the user's web-enabled device to take medication, presenting a use case for personal reminders as well as care takers who need to keep track of what meds they are administering. The user or caretaker can ask the Echo at any time how many of a certain medicine is remaining, how many days until the next available refill, and whether or not there are any refills remaining, and whether or not you've taken a certain dosage for the day.
